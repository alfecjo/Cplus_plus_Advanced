# C++ Advanced Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal C++ projects portfolio, built and organized on Ubuntu using the GCC compiler.  
This repository serves as a central hub for various projects that explore advanced features of C++, demonstrating practical implementations of powerful techniques and concepts.

Each subdirectory in this repository contains a standalone project — from templates and STL mastery to complex input/output handling.  
These projects are structured to reflect not only my learning journey but also my practical skills in modern C++ development.

## 🔧 Core Competencies Demonstrated

### 🧩 Templates
- Usage of function and class templates.
- Generic programming practices.
- Type-independent code design.

### 📚 Standard Template Library (STL)
- **Sequential Containers**: `vector`, `deque`, `list`
- **Associative Containers**: `set`, `map`, `multiset`, `multimap`
- **Container Adapters**: `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`

### ⚙️ STL Algorithms
- Non-modifying algorithms: `for_each`, `find`
- Modifying algorithms: `transform`, `copy`, `swap`
- Sorting and merging: `sort`, `stable_sort`, `merge`, `inplace_merge`

### 🔁 Iterators and Utilities
- Custom iterators and iterator traits.
- STL functors and utility functions.

### 💾 Advanced I/O Handling
- Console and file I/O operations.
- Stream formatting and string streams.

📌 **Note:** This project is evolving. More modules, examples, and advanced C++ features will be continuously added.


## 🐧 Environment

All projects are developed and tested using:
- **OS**: Ubuntu Linux
- **Compiler**: `g++` (GCC)
- **Build Tool**: Makefiles or raw g++ commands
- **Version Control**: Git

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository not only supports my preparation for CPP certification but also serves as a showcase of applied C++ knowledge.  
It reflects my ability to build modular, efficient, and idiomatic C++ applications from scratch in a Linux environment.

Feel free to explore, clone, and adapt the projects as needed. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
