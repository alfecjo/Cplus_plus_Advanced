# Dynamic Integer Array (C++)

## Purpose

This project implements a simple dynamic integer array in C++ to demonstrate low-level memory management without relying on STL containers like `std::vector`.

## Cause

In many educational and embedded systems contexts, understanding how arrays grow, shrink, and are managed manually is essential. This project showcases how to:

- Dynamically allocate and deallocate memory using `new` and `delete`
- Implement a custom `add()` and `delItem()` method
- Handle out-of-bounds access with exception safety
- Overload the subscript `[]` operator

## Effect

This implementation allows:

- Appending elements to a dynamic array
- Removing elements by index
- Safe access to elements with bounds checking
- Understanding the implications of manual memory handling
