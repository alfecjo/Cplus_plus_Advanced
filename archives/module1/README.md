# STL Containers â€“ Test Programs

This repository contains a collection of small C++ programs designed to explore and demonstrate the behavior and usage of various containers provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). These examples cover common operations, custom object handling, and iterator-based traversal across different container types.

## Purpose

The goal of these examples is to:

- Understand how STL containers like `vector`, `deque`, `list`, and `stack` work.
- Illustrate how elements can be inserted, erased, or printed using iterators and container member functions.
- Experiment with custom classes and overloading of operators in combination with containers.
- Demonstrate reverse iteration and memory management with dynamically allocated objects in containers.

## Containers Covered

### ðŸ“˜ STL Sequential Containers

### ðŸ“˜ STL Associative Containers

## Key Features

- Use of **custom types** (`class A`) within containers.
- Implementation of **`operator<<`** to support formatted output.
- Demonstration of **reverse iterators** (`rbegin`, `rend`).
- Explicit **memory management** (`new` and `delete`) when using containers of pointers.
- Template-based **generic print functions** for iterators.
