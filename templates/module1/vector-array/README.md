# Dynamic Integer Array with `std::vector` (C++)

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how to manage dynamic arrays in modern C++ using the standard container `std::vector`. While traditional manual memory management teaches low-level fundamentals, `std::vector` provides a safer, more scalable, and efficient alternative aligned with modern best practices.

## Cause

Understanding dynamic memory is crucial, but using `std::vector` allows developers to:

- Avoid manual memory leaks (`new` / `delete`)
- Benefit from built-in bounds checking and size management
- Focus on logic instead of infrastructure
- Apply idiomatic C++ practices for real-world projects

## Effect

This implementation allows:

- Dynamically appending and removing elements with ease
- Efficient memory handling managed by the STL
- Safe and intuitive element access using `[]` or `.at()`
- Modern C++ syntax and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

## Key Differences from Raw Arrays

| Feature                  | Manual Allocation (`new[]`)     | `std::vector<int>`              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Memory Management        | Manual (`new` / `delete`)        | Automatic via RAII              |
| Bounds Safety            | No                               | Safe with `.at()` or `range-for` |
| Resizing Support         | Needs reallocation logic         | Built-in with `.push_back()`     |
| Exception Safety         | Requires manual try/catch blocks | Handles internally               |
| STL Compatibility        | No                               | Fully compatible                 |

The techniques applied here are commonly used in:

- **Books**:
  - *Effective Modern C++* â€“ Scott Meyers
  - *Accelerated C++* â€“ Koenig & Moo

## Where to Find These Techniques in the App

You can see `std::vector` in action in:

- `ArrayVector.hpp` â€“ encapsulates the vector logic with add/remove/search methods.
- `main.cpp` â€“ shows a typical usage scenario including construction, insertion, deletion, and iteration.
- Exception-safe access is demonstrated using `.at(index)` in `main.cpp`.
